# A few things to note
- I added the stylesheet to a CDN so there where fewer files
- The deployed page can be found at: [AEO-TAKE-HOME](https://aeo-take-home.vercel.app/)
- All image assets are loaded in with a link to the s3 bucket object url
- I didn't add media queries to my styles, but i did use flexbox so it is responsive
  - Although it'r responsive, the site looks best at 600 x 1024 pixels
- I didnt focus too much on font types, or font size. My main focus was getting the overall layout to look as close to the picture i received as possible
- I assumed the main goal was to perform the task in the given time frame
- I did 3/4 of the project on codepen before i switched to VS Code so there aren't many commits.
